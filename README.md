## 🎮 How to Play

* The player have to control the paddle using the left and the right arrows on the keyboard.

* When the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears and increments the player's score.

* To win the game, the player has to break all the bricks on each level, and he has to complete 3 levels, when he passes from a level to another, the number of bricks increases and also the speed of the ball.

* The player has 3 lives, when he loses a life, the ball position resets and a chance is given to continue playing the game.

* If he loses all the 3 lives, it's a game over and a game over message is shown, and a "play again" button to play over.
